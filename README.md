In this course, I learned foundational programming principles through the unique challenge of creating macros for EverQuest, one of the classic MMORPGs. 
Working in Lua and Perl, I focused on understanding scripting, automation, and game interaction within the constraints of an older game engine. 
This hands-on approach not only helped solidify key concepts but also sparked a deeper appreciation for how programming can be applied in interactive environments.
